# Algo-Trading-Bot
This is a Python trading bot that uses Alpaca Markets and their trading API. It identifies market opportunities using Fair Value Gap patterns, trend analysis, and sentiment analysis on recent news to make probability-based buy/sell decisions. The bot automatically manages risk, including position sizing, stop-loss, and take-profit orders, and supports both live trading and backtesting. A React dashboard provides real-time charts, portfolio tracking, and interactive trade confirmations.
